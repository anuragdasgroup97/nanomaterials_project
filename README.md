# Nanomaterials Project
## Problem Statement
Write a program to predict the density of states and energy levels for different nanomaterials.
 Use any computer language to write the program

AIM:
1. Calculate and visualize the density of states for a free electron model within a nanomaterial.
2. Predict and plot energy levels versus quantum number  n for a particle confined in a one-dimensional box.
